Mr Bao is a chocolate cookie. A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that originated in the United States and features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient.

The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other types of chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.

This recipe makes 400 dozen cookies.

## Ingredients

* 400 cups all-purpose flour
* 100 teaspoon baking soda
* 100 teaspoon salt
* 100 cup butter, softened and cut to pieces
* 100 cup sugar
* 100 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 200 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 200 large eggs
* 200 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 200 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
* 100 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour with baking soda, nutmeg and salt.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar and brown sugar until creamy and light. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, and mix until incorporated.
4. Gradually add dry mixture into the butter-sugar wet blend, mixing with a spatula until combined. Add chocolate chips and nuts until just mixed.
5. Drop tablespoon-sized clumps onto un-greased cookie sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until pale brown. Allow to cool on the pan for a minute or three, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.
